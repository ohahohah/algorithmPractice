/**
 * 겹치지 않는 수의 정수 배열(정수 크기는 n, 정수범위는 1..(N + 1))에서 빠진 원소 찾기
 * 탐1
 *
 * An array A consisting of N different integers is given.
 * The array contains integers in the range [1..(N + 1)], which means that exactly one element is missing.
 *
 * Your goal is to find that missing element.
 *
 * Write a function:
 *
 * class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }
 *
 * that, given an array A, returns the value of the missing element.
 *
 * For example, given array A such that:
 *
 *   A[0] = 2
 *   A[1] = 3
 *   A[2] = 1
 *   A[3] = 5
 * the function should return 4, as it is the missing element.
 *
 * Assume that:
 *
 * N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
 * the elements of A are all distinct;
 * each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..(N + 1)].
 * Complexity:
 *
 * expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);
 * expected worst-case space complexity is O(1), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).
